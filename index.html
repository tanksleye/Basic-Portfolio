                        <p>
                            My name is Eleseba J Tanksley
                            But my superhero friends call me JET. Why JET you ask? Because I am a rapid stream of energy.
                            I have an energetic, high intensity
                            personality with a calm and cooling demeanor. Meaning I'm fun to be around
                            most of the time always. 
                        </p>
           
                       <p>
                           I am eager to learn and am willing to try new things. New to coding but
                           give it time, let the pressure build up and I will take you on a flight that is unique and outragious (in a good way).
                       </p>

                       <p>
                           I plan to use my skills to improve potiental clients websites. 
                           I would like to focus on start up businesses after I have worked for some 
                           well establied companies at first.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                           I would love to work for pixar in their action figure department or possibly
                           in the development of online enducational games using the Disney Pixar characters.
